## My process

Go through design styles and than take a good look at the design of the page to make sure I have the good grasp of what is a good approach to create the product. I go step by step and solve all the small 'bugs' as I go. Never leave it for later!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
```

### Continued development

Really interested in React now so I though to build a couple of small websites just to make sure that I got these basics right :D
